LearnFast Online Course Registration Platform
This project simulates a basic online course registration platform for a fictitious education startup called "LearnFast." The objective is to create a complete user flow, from a landing page to course details, registration, and confirmation, laying the groundwork for tracking user interactions with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager (GTM).

üéØ Objective
The primary goal is to build a user journey for course sign-ups and later define custom events in GA4 to track:

Page visits across the funnel.

Views of the course details.

Clicks on "Apply" or "Register" buttons.

Successful registrations (reaching the confirmation page).

The entire user funnel performance.

üåê Real-Life Scenario
LearnFast is promoting a new Data Analytics course. This website serves as the front-end to drive sign-ups for this course.

üìÇ Pages Included
The project consists of 5 interconnected HTML pages, each representing a step in the user journey:

index.html: The main Landing Page introducing LearnFast and featuring the Data Analytics course.

course.html: The Course Details Page providing comprehensive information about the Data Analytics program.

register.html: The Application/Registration Form Page where users can sign up for the course.

confirmation.html: The Thank You Page displayed after a successful registration.

about.html: A generic About Us / Contact Page for company information.

‚ú® Features
Responsive Design: All pages are designed using Tailwind CSS to be fully responsive and look good on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Clear Navigation: A consistent navigation bar allows users to easily move between key sections.

User Flow Simulation: Pages are linked to simulate a typical online course registration funnel.

Dynamic Confirmation: The confirmation.html page dynamically displays the user's first name from the registration form (if submitted via GET method).

üöÄ Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript: A small script on confirmation.html for dynamic content.

üèÉ How to Run Locally
To view and interact with this project on your computer:

Save all HTML files (index.html, course.html, register.html, confirmation.html, about.html) into the same folder on your local machine.

Open index.html in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.

Navigate through the website using the provided links and buttons to experience the simulated user journey.

Note on "Cannot GET" errors: If you encounter "Cannot GET /path/to/file.html" errors, it typically means your browser cannot find the file at the expected path. Ensure all HTML files are in the same directory as explained in step 1. For more complex local hosting scenarios, consider using a simple local web server (e.g., Python's http.server or Node.js's live-server).

üìà Future Enhancements (Analytics & Tracking)
This project is set up to be the foundation for implementing web analytics. The next steps would involve:

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Setup: Creating a GA4 property and configuring data streams.

Google Tag Manager (GTM) Implementation: Adding the GTM container snippet to all pages.

Custom Event Tracking: Using GTM to define and fire specific events to GA4 for actions like:

course_viewed (on course.html load)

apply_button_click (on the "Apply Now" button click on index.html or course.html)

registration_started (on register.html load)

registration_completed (on confirmation.html load)

GA4 Conversions: Marking registration_completed as a conversion event in GA4.

Funnel Exploration: Using GA4's Funnel Exploration reports to visualize the user journey from landing to confirmation.
